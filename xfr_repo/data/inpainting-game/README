This directory contains data (as csv files) and images for 95
subjects. The csv files are all at top level in the IJBC
subdirectory. The images are stored in a set of compressed tar files,
one per subject, also in the IJBC subdirectory.
To unpack all of the images, run the unpack-aligned.sh script in this
directory; the resulting directory structure should match the list in
aligned-files.txt.
